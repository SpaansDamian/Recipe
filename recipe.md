## Instructions;

1. Peel and roughly chop the onion. Peel and finely chop the ginger and garlic cloves. Drain and rise the chickpeas. Pick the coriander leaves and finely chop the stalks. Measure out your spices.
2. In a large flat non-stick pan, heat 1.5 Tbsp of oil over a high heat, when hot add the onions and cook for 3 mins until they start to brown, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to medium and add the ginger, garlic and coriander stalks and cook for 2 mins, stirring so the garlic does not burn. Add all the spices and mix well and cook for a minute. Add the chopped tomatoes and 1 tsp of salt and cook for 3-4 mins. Transfer carefully to a food processor and blend until smooth.
3. Add back into the pan, along with the drained chickpeas and heat for 1-2 mins
4. To finish add the spinach and mix through until it wilts , taste and adjust the seasoning to your liking by adding more salt, pepper, lime or chilli.
5. Add the fresh chopped coriander and set aside while you make your dosa
6. To make your dosa
7. Sieve the flour in a large mixing bowl. Add in the spice and mix. Make a well in the middle and add in the milk and use a whisk and mix well so there are no lumps.
8. Add ½ tsp of neutral tasting oil to a medium to large (30cm) non-stick pan and wipe lightly with kitchen paper to remove any excess oil. Put on a high heat. When hot, reduce to a medium heat, use a ladle or large serving spoon to add approx 60ml or roughly quarter of the batter to the pan. Use the base of the ladle to spread the batter quickly and lightly around the pan to nearly cover it and make a thin pancake. Cook for 2 mins per side, using a spatula (we like to use a silicon one) to release and turn your pancake. Repeat until you have 4 bigger or 6 smaller pancakes – you can keep warm in a preheated 100 C oven if needed.
9. Heat up the channa masala and with the dosa and enjoy!
